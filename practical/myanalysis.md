This project examines the relationship between the quantity partY and a variety of measures of physical and intellectual development, including IQ (full, verbal, and performance), height, weight, and MRI voxels classified as brain, as a measure of physical brain size. Significant relationships were found between partY and brain size (MRI voxel counts) as well as performance IQ.

## Methods
To evaluate the hypothesis that partY is associated with measures of physical and intellectual development and function, a two-stage analytical procedure was used. First, an initial exploration of the data was performed, in order to understand how the data were distributed. To do this, scatter plots were generated between each pair of variables, and, by visual inspection of the data, a number of candidate predictors were selected.

These predictors were then tested in a linear regression model, which predicted partY values from each of the candidates. In addition, candidates were tested together in a multivariate regression model, to determine whether prediction accuracy was increased. The predictors included in this combined model were tested to ensure that they themselves were not correlated.

## Results
The exploratory analysis revealed that
